A very muscular man drove past me in his Audi, blasting Rammstein, and wearing a Dirndel.
A lonely Brawurst was sitting in a Raesfeld next to a piece of brot, then old man Gauss being so smart combined them and so the hotdog was born.
On a random hill bratwurst, bier, and Lederhose were all magically combined to create the German.
