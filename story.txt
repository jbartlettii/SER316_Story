A very muscular man drove past me in his Audi, blasting Rammstein, and wearing a Dirndel.
A lonely Brawurst was sitting in a Raesfeld next to a piece of brot, then old man Gauss being so smart combined them and so the hotdog was born.
On a random hill bratwurst, bier, and Lederhose were all magically combined to create the German.
In Berlin, the brot made the attendees of the biergarten handle their bier better.
Afterwards, the brot got its BMW to head to the flughafen.
On the way to the flughafen he listened to a podcast on Gauss.
Unfortunately the Klimaanlage was not working so he ran the BMW into a Porche as revenge.
Then, to make matters worst, the muscular man hit his Audi into the other cars, causing a havoc on Hauptstrasse.
Leaving his wrecked car, he went to a ratskeller inside the flughafen.
